I'm a first-year Mathematics PhD student in Atlanta, Georgia. My interests lie in Information Geometry, Statistical Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Cognitive & Systems Neuroscience. I also play the board game Go; you can reach out to me on [OGS](https://online-go.com/user/view/270386) if you'd like to play a game, or try out a Go variant I developed: [Infinite Go](http://infinite-go.com).

Lately I have been studying differential geometry, dynamical systems, and algebraic topology.

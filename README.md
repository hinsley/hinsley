I'm a Mathematics and Computer Science student from Northeast Georgia. My interests lie in Information Geometry, Statistical Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Cognitive & Systems Neuroscience. I also play the board game Go; you can reach out to me on [OGS](https://online-go.com/user/view/270386) if you'd like to play a game, or try out a Go variant I developed: [Infinite Go](http://infinite-go.com).
